	O_DIRECT feature enabled
	SYNC Mode. 
	File size set to 2048 kB
	Record Size 8 kB
	Command line used: iozone -i 0 -I -o -s 2048 -r 8 -t 2 -F /mnt/mem/gtest_file1 /mnt/mem/gtest_file2
	Output is in kBytes/sec
	Time Resolution = 0.000001 seconds.
	Processor cache size set to 1024 kBytes.
	Processor cache line size set to 32 bytes.
	File stride size set to 17 * record size.
	Throughput test with 2 processes
	Each process writes a 2048 kByte file in 8 kByte records

	Children see throughput for  2 initial writers 	=  347600.58 kB/sec
	Parent sees throughput for  2 initial writers 	=  320475.32 kB/sec
	Min throughput per process 			=  163940.39 kB/sec 
	Max throughput per process 			=  183660.19 kB/sec
	Avg throughput per process 			=  173800.29 kB/sec
	Min xfer 					=    1824.00 kB

	Children see throughput for  2 rewriters 	= 1494537.75 kB/sec
	Parent sees throughput for  2 rewriters 	= 1363956.67 kB/sec
	Min throughput per process 			=  732667.88 kB/sec 
	Max throughput per process 			=  761869.88 kB/sec
	Avg throughput per process 			=  747268.88 kB/sec
