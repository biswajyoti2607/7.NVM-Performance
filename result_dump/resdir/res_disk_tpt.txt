	O_DIRECT feature enabled
	SYNC Mode. 
	File size set to 2048 kB
	Record Size 8 kB
	Command line used: iozone -i 0 -I -o -s 2048 -r 8 -t 2 -F test/gtest1 test/gtest2
	Output is in kBytes/sec
	Time Resolution = 0.000001 seconds.
	Processor cache size set to 1024 kBytes.
	Processor cache line size set to 32 bytes.
	File stride size set to 17 * record size.
	Throughput test with 2 processes
	Each process writes a 2048 kByte file in 8 kByte records

	Children see throughput for  2 initial writers 	=   11284.25 kB/sec
	Parent sees throughput for  2 initial writers 	=   11125.06 kB/sec
	Min throughput per process 			=    5570.01 kB/sec 
	Max throughput per process 			=    5714.24 kB/sec
	Avg throughput per process 			=    5642.12 kB/sec
	Min xfer 					=    2000.00 kB

	Children see throughput for  2 rewriters 	=   31503.40 kB/sec
	Parent sees throughput for  2 rewriters 	=   31399.34 kB/sec
	Min throughput per process 			=   15688.59 kB/sec 
	Max throughput per process 			=   15814.80 kB/sec
	Avg throughput per process 			=   15751.70 kB/sec
	Min xfer 					=    2032.00 kB
